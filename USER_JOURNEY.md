# AudioLeap Demo Generator: User & Sales Journey

This document outlines the end-to-end user journey for a sales representative using the AudioLeap self-service demo generator, from initiating a sales call to tracking a successful installation. It includes the integrated workflow with Google Sheets for team-wide visibility.

---

## **Participants**

*   **Sales Representative (SR):** The primary user of the AudioLeap Demo Generator app.
*   **Potential Partner (Client):** The person on the other end of the sales call, representing a website (e.g., `tech-review-weekly.com`).
*   **Sales Manager:** A stakeholder who needs visibility into the sales pipeline and demo effectiveness.

## **The Live Sales Call Journey**

### **Phase 1: The Interactive Workshop (First 60 Seconds)**

The goal of this phase is to immediately demonstrate value and engage the client in a collaborative, hands-on experience.

1.  **The Conversation Starter:**
    *   **SR:** "To show you how AudioLeap would look on your site, I'm going to generate a live, interactive demo for you right now. Can you confirm your website is `tech-review-weekly.com`?"
    *   The SR opens the **AudioLeap Demo Generator**.

2.  **Instant Visual Wow-Factor (Seconds 0-10):**
    *   The SR enters `https://www.tech-review-weekly.com` into the **Website Analysis** input and clicks "Analyze".
    *   **App Action:** The system fetches the website, analyzes its CSS for key design tokens (colors, fonts), and identifies the tech stack.
    *   **User Experience:** Almost immediately, the analysis results appear, and a fully interactive visual clone of the partner's website loads in the **Live Preview** section.
    *   **SR:** "As you can see, our tool has instantly analyzed your site's design and created a live preview. What you're seeing is a functional clone of your homepage."

3.  **Collaborative Placement (Seconds 10-30):**
    *   **SR:** "Now, let's find the perfect spot for the player. Where would you naturally expect to see it on an article page? Just guide me."
    *   As the partner describes a location (e.g., "right below the author's byline"), the SR moves their mouse over the live preview. The client sees elements being highlighted in real-time.
    *   The SR clicks the chosen element. A small dialog appears asking for placement confirmation. The SR clicks "Place After".

4.  **The Player Appears (Seconds 30-45):**
    *   The audio player instantly appears in the preview, perfectly positioned.
    *   **App Action:** The player's accent color is automatically set to the primary color that was identified during the analysis phase.
    *   **SR:** "There it is. And notice how it's already picked up your brand's primary color to seamlessly match your design. We can also try different player styles."
    *   The SR quickly changes the **Player Type** in the configuration section, and the player in the preview updates instantly, showcasing flexibility.

### **Phase 2: Creating a Tangible Asset & Automated Record-Keeping**

The goal of this phase is to provide the client with a persistent "leave-behind" asset and to automate all internal record-keeping, eliminating manual data entry for the SR.

5.  **Saving the Demo (Seconds 45-60):**
    *   Once the client is happy, the SR clicks the **"Save & Share"** button.
    *   **App Action (Internal Database):** The complete demo configuration (URL, player settings, placement selector) is saved to the internal Firestore database, generating a unique ID.
    *   **App Action (Google Sheets - NEW):** The system authenticates with the Google Sheets API and **automatically appends a new row** to the central "Sales Demo Tracker" sheet. This row is instantly populated with:
        *   `Demo ID`: The unique ID from Firestore.
        *   `Partner Website`: `tech-review-weekly.com`
        *   `Sales Rep`: (The logged-in user's name).
        *   `Demo Created At`: The current timestamp.
        *   `Status`: `Pending`.
        *   `Installation Date`: (Blank).
        *   `Shareable Link`: The URL to the demo page.
    *   **User Experience:** A dialog box appears with the unique, shareable demo URL.
    *   **SR:** "Perfect. I've just saved this exact configuration and I'm sending you the link right now. You can share that with your technical team. Our system has also logged this demo so the whole team can track its progress."

6.  **Pivoting to Integration:**
    *   The SR discusses implementation options with the client.
    *   **If the client has developers:** The SR clicks the "HTML" or "React" tab to show the simple code snippet.
    *   **If the client uses WordPress:** The SR clicks the "WordPress" tab. The form is pre-filled. The SR explains that they can generate a custom-built plugin with one click.

### **Phase 3: The Automated Follow-Up & Team Visibility**

This phase happens asynchronously after the call and is designed to provide the SR with a data-driven reason for a timely follow-up, while giving management a clear view of the sales pipeline.

7.  **The Installation Event (Post-Call):**
    *   The client's technical team receives the shared demo link. They eventually use the provided code snippet or plugin to install the player on their live or staging site.
    *   When the player script loads for the first time, it sends a one-time "ping" back to our application's API.
    *   **App Action (API Trigger):** The API receives the ping with the publication name (`tech-review-weekly`).
        1.  It updates the demo's record in the internal Firestore database, setting `isInstalled` to `true` and adding the `installedAt` timestamp.
        2.  It sends an **in-app and email notification** to the SR: "ðŸŽ‰ tech-review-weekly.com has installed the player!"
        3.  **It updates the Google Sheet:** The system finds the corresponding row (by matching the website URL or Demo ID) and updates the cells:
            *   `Status`: Changed from `Pending` to `âœ… Installed`.
            *   `Installation Date`: Filled with the current timestamp.

8.  **The Follow-Up & Management Overview:**
    *   **SR:** Receives the notification and now has a perfect, non-intrusive reason to contact the client: "Hi! I saw you just installed the player. How is it looking on your end?"
    *   **Sales Manager:** Can open the "Sales Demo Tracker" Google Sheet at any time. They have a real-time, at-a-glance view of:
        *   How many demos are being created daily/weekly.
        *   The conversion rate from "Pending" to "Installed".
        *   The average time-to-install for partners.
        *   Which sales reps are generating the most successful demos.

This complete, automated loop turns the demo tool from a simple visual aid into an integrated part of the sales and reporting workflow.
