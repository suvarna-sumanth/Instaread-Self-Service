## User Guide (for Sales & Support)

This guide explains how to use the demo generator to create and share live demos with potential partners.

### How to Create a Demo

The process is designed to be quick and intuitive, allowing you to create a demo live during a sales call.

1.  **Analyze the Website:**

    - Enter the partner's full website URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`) into the **Website Analysis** input box.
    - Click the **"Analyze"** button.
    - The tool will automatically analyze the site's design (colors, fonts) and generate a live, interactive preview in the section below.

2.  **Configure the Player:**

    - In the **Player Configuration** section, you can customize the player's appearance.
    - **Player Type:** Choose a visual style from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Default", "Short Design"). The preview will update instantly.
    - **Accent Color:** The tool automatically suggests an accent color based on its analysis. You can change this using the color picker to perfectly match the partner's branding.

3.  **Place the Player:**

    - In the **Live Preview & Placement** section, move your mouse over the cloned website.
    - Click on the exact element where you want the player to appear (e.g., just below the article headline).
    - A dialog will pop up asking you to confirm placement **"Before"** or **"After"** the element you clicked. Choose one.
    - The player will instantly appear in the preview at your chosen location. You can clear the placement and try again if needed.
    - **Automatic Placement Check**: The tool will automatically analyze the website's structure. If it detects a complex structure that might cause issues, it will show a warning, letting you know that a developer may need to adjust the generated WordPress plugin for the best results.

4.  **Save and Share:**

    - Once you are happy with the placement and style, click the **"Save & Share"** button.
    - A dialog will appear with a unique, shareable link to the demo you just created.
    - Copy this link and send it to the partner. This link provides a live, interactive version of their site with the player integrated.
    - Saving the demo also automatically adds an entry to the team's central **Google Sheet tracker**, marking the status as "Pending".

5.  **Get Integration Code (for their developers):**
    - The **Get Integration Code** section provides the necessary code snippets for the partner's technical team.
    - **HTML/React:** For most partners, the simple HTML snippet is all they need.
    - **WordPress:** For partners using WordPress, you can configure and generate a custom-built plugin for them automatically.

### Tracking Installation Status

- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Click the **Dashboard** button in the header to view all created demos. The dashboard is live and updates automatically in real-time. You can see which demos are "Pending" and which are "Installed" without ever needing to refresh the page.
- **Notifications:** When a partner installs the player script on their site, the status in the dashboard and Google Sheet will automatically update to "âœ… Installed", and you will receive an in-app and email notification.

## Developer Guide

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (with real-time listeners for the dashboard)
- **AI Analysis**: OpenAI API (`gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Automation**: GitHub API & GitHub Actions for WordPress plugin generation.
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **Spreadsheet Integration**: Google Sheets API

### Project Structure

- `src/app/`: Main pages and layouts.
  - `(main)/`: Core app routes (generator, dashboard).
  - `demo/[id]/`: Dynamic page for rendering shared demos.
  - `api/`: API routes, like the installation confirmation endpoint.
- `src/components/`: Shared React components.
  - `sections/`: Major UI sections of the generator page.
- `src/lib/`: Core utilities and server actions.
  - `actions.ts`: Server Actions handling backend logic (saving demos, generating plugins).
  - `firebase-client.ts`: Firebase client SDK initialization (for client components).
  - `firebase.ts`: Firebase Admin SDK initialization (for server-side code).
  - `send-email.ts`: Nodemailer email sending utility.
- `src/services/`: Data access layer. Handles all communication with Firestore and Google Sheets.
- `src/ai/`: AI-related logic, including website analysis flows.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.

### Key Architectural Concepts

- **Hybrid SSR and Real-Time Dashboard**: The dashboard at `/dashboard` uses a hybrid rendering approach for the best user experience.
  1.  **Initial Load (SSR)**: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` is a Server Component that fetches the initial list of demos via `getAllDemos()`. This provides a fast, non-interactive first paint of the data.
  2.  **Client-Side Hydration & Real-Time Updates**: The server-rendered data is passed to a client component, `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`. This component then establishes a real-time listener to the Firestore database using the `onSnapshot` function. Any changes in the database (new demos, status updates) are instantly pushed to the client and reflected in the UI without requiring a page refresh. This provides a seamless, live experience for the user.
- **Self-Contained Services**: The application abstracts all external service interactions (Firestore, Google Sheets, GitHub API) into a `services` directory. This makes the application more modular and easier to maintain. If we needed to switch databases, we would only need to update the `demo-service.ts` file.

### Automated Placement Logic

A key feature of this tool is its ability to automatically generate a CSS selector when a user clicks on the live preview. The goal is to create a selector that is both accurate and robust enough to work across multiple pages of the same site. This is handled by two key functions in `src/components/sections/live-preview-section.tsx`.

1.  **Selector Generation (`generateSelector`)**: This function creates a CSS selector for the clicked element. It's designed to prioritize stability over specificity by following these rules:
    -   It first looks for a unique `id` on the element or one of its parents. An ID is the most stable identifier.
    -   If no ID is found, it searches for common, descriptive class names that often denote main content areas (e.g., `article`, `post`, `content`, `entry`).
    -   It limits the selector's depth to avoid creating overly long and brittle chains (e.g., `div > div > div > p`).
    -   Alongside the selector, it calculates an `nth` index. This identifies *which* element was clicked if the selector matches multiple elements on the page (e.g., the 3rd `p` tag in the article body).

2.  **Fragility Check (`isSelectorFragile`)**: After a selector is generated, this function immediately analyzes it to predict if it might break on other pages. A selector is flagged as "fragile" if it meets any of these criteria:
    -   **It's too nested**: Selectors with many levels (e.g., more than 4 `>`) are often tied to a very specific DOM structure that can easily change.
    -   **It relies on position**: Selectors using `:nth-of-type` are brittle because adding or removing an element earlier in the page will break them.
    -   **It lacks a good anchor**: If the selector doesn't contain a unique ID or a meaningful class name, it's likely too generic and unreliable.

If a selector is determined to be fragile, the UI automatically displays a warning to the user and sets the WordPress plugin's injection strategy to "Custom", signaling that a developer may need to fine-tune the placement.

### Getting Started (Local Setup)

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**

    - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    - Copy the contents of the `.env.example` section below and fill in the values with your credentials.

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

### Development & Testing Features

When `NODE_ENV` is set to `development` in your `.env` file, several testing features are enabled:

- **Mocked AI Analysis:** To save costs and speed up development, the website analysis is mocked by default when `USE_AI_ANALYSIS` is `"false"`. Set it to `"true"` and provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to test with the real AI service.
- **Console Emails:** Email notifications for installations are **not** sent. Instead, a confirmation message is logged to the server console, showing you who the email would have been sent to. This is useful for verifying the installation tracking API (`/api/installs/confirm`).
- **Demo Status Reset:** On the **Dashboard**, the actions menu for each demo includes a "Reset Status" option. This allows you to reset an "Installed" demo back to "Pending", which is useful for re-testing the installation notification flow without having to create a new demo. This option is hidden in production.
- **Test Demo Link:** When you save a demo, the "Save & Share" dialog includes a "Test Demo" button that opens the shareable link in a new tab. This is for quick verification and is hidden in production.
