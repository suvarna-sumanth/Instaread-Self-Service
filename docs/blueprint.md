## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trustworthiness and innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, to create a clean, modern backdrop that complements the vibrant blue. It should be visually the same hue as the primary, but desaturated.
- Accent color: Choose a complementary orange (#FF8C00) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. The accent needs to contrast with the primary in brightness and saturation, for affordance.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary and fashionable aesthetic, lending a precise feel for a design-focused app.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) as 'Poppins' may be unsuitable for longer texts, to promote readability, with its objective and neutral design.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to maintain a clean and modern look.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all elements.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide visual feedback and enhance user engagement.
